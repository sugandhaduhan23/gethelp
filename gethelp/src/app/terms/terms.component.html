        information we have about you, or to operate and manage the survey, contest or similar offering in connection

        not share your current location obtained in this manner with other Users.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong> are described in our&nbsp;<a

        (<strong>&ldquo;Interest-Based Advertising&rdquo;</strong>).</p>
    <p>For more information and to understand your choices regarding third-party ads, please see our Cookie Policy.

        information as set out in the official rules that govern the promotion as well as for administrative purposes

        pixel on our Sites and may share your email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom
        Audiences.</p>
    <p><strong>Other Users</strong>. Gethelp facilitates contact between Clients and Taskers and reserves the right
        to share one User&rsquo;s contact information (e.g., name, phone number, email, or postal address) with other
        Users, or with the recipient User&rsquo;s legal or other authorized representative, in order to: (1) facilitate
        or communicate the resolution of an investigation or dispute related to or arising from an interaction between
        two or more Users of the Gethelp Platform; or (2) facilitate the performance of a Task. This exchange of
        information is essential to the operation of the Gethelp Platform.</p>
    <p><strong>Legal Obligations</strong>. Gethelp and our Third Party Agents may disclose your Personal Information
        or User Generated Content to courts, law enforcement, governmental or public authorities, tax authorities or
        authorised third parties, if and to the extent required or permitted to do so by law or where disclosure is
        reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with Gethelp&rsquo;s legal or regulatory obligations; (ii) respond to a
        court order, warrant or subpoena; (iii) respond to a valid legal request relating to an investigation into
        alleged criminal or illegal activity; or (iv) respond to or address any other activity that may expose us to
        legal or regulatory liability.</p>
    <p>In jurisdictions where Gethelp is, according to applicable law, required to collect or remit information about
        Users&rsquo; permits, licences, tax, or social security registrations, Gethelp and our Third Party Agents may
        disclose information, including but not limited to, User contact details, identification information,
        transaction dates and amounts, license and permit status, and tax identification number(s) to applicable
        governmental authorities.</p>
    <p>Gethelp reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of the
        Gethelp Platform in the absence of a court order, warrant, or subpoena, to the extent permitted by applicable
        law, if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interfering
        with the rights of Users, the general public, or Gethelp or its partners, parents or affiliates.</p>
    <p>It is our policy to provide notice to Users before producing their information in response to law enforcement
        requests unless (i) we are prohibited or otherwise constrained by law or court order from doing so, (ii) we have
        reason to believe the User&rsquo;s account has been compromised such that the notice would go to the wrong
        person, or notice would otherwise be counterproductive or would create a risk to safety, or (iii) it is an
        emergency request and prior notice would be impractical (in which case we may provide notice after the fact).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Merger or Acquisition</strong>. Gethelp reserves the right to share information in connection with, or
        during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, or any other type of acquisition or

    <h2>8. Gethelp&apos;s Information Retention Policy</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data for as long as you are a User in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and
        for such longer period as may be in our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations (see
        Exhibit A for exemplar document retention periods). We may also retain data from which you cannot directly be
        identified, for example where stored against a randomly-generated identifier so we know the data relates to a
        single User, but we cannot tell who that User is. We use this kind of data for research purposes and to help us
        develop and improve our services, and we take appropriate measures to ensure you cannot be re-identified from
        this data.</p>
    <h2>9. Gethelp&rsquo;s Security of Collected Information</h2>
    <p>Your Gethelp account is password-protected so that only you and authorized Gethelp staff have access to
        your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, if
        you share a computer, you should sign out of your Gethelp account and close the browser window before someone
        else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third
        parties.</p>
    <p>Gethelp implements and maintains reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to
        help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and
        destruction. Gethelp has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives,
        periodically reviewing security, and making sure that every Gethelp employee is aware of our security
        practices. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the
        security of information about you.</p>
    <h2>10. Notification of Changes</h2>
    <p>Gethelp&apos;s Privacy Policy is periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This Privacy Policy might
        change as Gethelp updates and expands the Gethelp Platform. Gethelp will endeavor to notify you of any

        we have collected information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, please let us know by contacting

        California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (<strong>&ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;</strong>) provides additional rights to
        know, delete and opt out, and requires business collecting or disclosing Personal Information to provide notice
        of rights California residents have and can exercise.</p>
    <p><strong>California Notice of Collection</strong>. We have collected Personal Information corresponding to the
        following categories enumerated in the CCPA, including within the last 12 months.</p>

        However, to the extent &ldquo;sale&rdquo; under the CCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology
        activities such as those disclosed in Section 5, Gethelp&rsquo;s Use of Information, as a &ldquo;sale,&rdquo;
        we will comply with applicable law as to such activity.</p>
