            we collect, how we use it, and when and with whom we share it. This Policy applies to all sites, mobile

        </p>
        <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
        <p>How we collect and store information depends on how you access and use the Platform. We collect information
            in multiple ways including when you provide information directly to us, when you permit third-parties to
            provide information to us, and when we passively collect information from you, such as information collected
            from your browser or device.</p>
        <p><em>Information You Provide Directly to Us</em></p>
        <p>We may collect information from you during your use or access of the Platform, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you register for an account;</li>
            <li>When you participate in polls or surveys;</li>
            <li>When you enroll for electronic newsletters;</li>
            <li>When you request a quote or other information;</li>
            <li>When you submit or respond to a quote;</li>
            <li>When you make a purchase;</li>
            <li>When you fill out any forms;</li>

            <li>When you download or use one of our mobile applications; or</li>
            <li>When you otherwise communicate with us or other Users through the Platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This list is illustrative, not exhaustive; the Privacy Policy applies to all uses of the Platform.</p>
        <p>The information you provide directly to us may concern you or others and may include, but is not limited to:
            (a) name; (b) zip code; (c) email address; (d) home or business telephone number; (e) home, business or
            mailing address; (f) demographic information (e.g., gender, age, political preference, education, race or
            ethnic origin, and other information relevant to User surveys and/or offers); (g) date of birth; (h)
            insurance information; (i) photographs; (j) information about your project, home, request or need; (k) video
            or audio files; (l) in certain circumstances, payment and/or identity verification information; and/or (m)
            any other content you include in communications with other Users through the Platform or communications with
            us. It may also include information specific to services you are requesting or offering through the
            Platform, such as a business name, service description, qualifications and credentials. You are not required
            to provide us with such information, but certain features of the Platform may not be accessible or
            available, absent the provision of the requested information.</p>
        <p><em>Information from Affiliates, Social Networking Sites, and Other Non-Affiliated Third-Parties</em></p>
        <p>We may collect information about you or others through Gethelp affiliates or through non-affiliated
            third-parties. For example, you may be able to access the Platform through a social networking account, such
            as Facebook. If you access the Platform through your Facebook account, you may allow us to have access to
            certain information in your Facebook profile. This may include your name, profile picture, gender, networks,
            user IDs, list of friends, location, date of birth, email address, photos, videos, people you follow and/or
            who follow you, and/or your posts or &quot;likes.&quot; Social networking sites, such as Facebook, have
            their own policies for handling your information. For a description of how these sites may use and disclose
            your information, including any information you make public, please consult those sites&apos; privacy
            policies. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal information it
            collects about you.</p>
        <p>We may collect information about you or others through non-affiliated third-parties. For example, to the
            extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole discretion, ask for and collect supplemental information about
            you from third-parties, such as information about your credit from a credit bureau, or information to verify
            your identity or trustworthiness, or for other fraud or safety protection purposes. We may combine
            information that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we obtain from such
            third-parties and information derived from any other products or services we provide.</p>
        <p>Through non-affiliated third-parties, we may also collect information that demonstrates the occurrence of an
            off-Platform communication between a Consumer and a Service Professional in order to ensure accurate
            charging of fees imposed upon Service Professionals and to enforce the Terms of Use. Except as explicitly
            stated herein, we will not collect or store the contents of any off-Platform communication between a
            Consumer and a Service Professional.</p>
        <p>If you send text messages with a Consumer or Service Professional using the telephone number for that User
            available on the Platform, we may use a third-party service provider to track these text messages. We track
            these text messages for fraud prevention, to ensure appropriate charging of fees, to enforce our Terms of
            Use, and for quality and training purposes. As part of this process, Gethelp and the third-party service
            provider will receive in real time and store data about your text message, including the date and time of
            the text message, your phone number, and the content of the text message.</p>
        <p><em>Information That Is Passively or Automatically Collected</em></p>
        <p><em>Device/Usage Information.</em> We and our third-party service providers, which include ad networks and
            analytics companies such as DoubleClick and Google Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other
            tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you
            use to access the Platform. As described further below, we may collect and analyze information including but
            not limited to (a) browser type; (b) ISP or operating system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e)
            referring or exit pages; (f) page views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers (e.g. IDFA or Android
            ID); and (i) the type of device that you use. We may also track and record when and how frequently you
            access or use the Platform, or how you browse the Platform. We use this information (including the
            information collected by our third-party service providers) for Platform analytics (including to determine
            which portions of the Platform are used most frequently and what our Users like/do not like), to assist in
            determining relevant advertising (both on and off the Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising
            campaigns, and as otherwise described in this Policy.</p>
        <p><em>Location Information.</em>When you use the Platform, we may collect general location information (such as
            IP address). If you install our mobile app, we may ask you to grant us access to your mobile device&apos;s
            geolocation data. If you grant such permission, we may collect information about your precise geolocation,
            and we may use that information to improve the Platform, including providing you with location-based
            features (e.g. for identification of Pro Services available near you). To deliver customized content and
            advertising, we may share your location information with our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access
            the Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking
            information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your
            device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer&apos;s instructions for further details. If you
            disable certain functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the Platform.</p>
        <p><em>Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies.</em>We and our third-party service providers may use cookies,
            clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand User behavior, personalize
            preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Platform. These technologies, for example, may
            allow us to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the
            pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We also use certain of
            these technologies to deliver advertisements through the Platform that may interest you. We or our
            third-party service providers also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our Users to help us
            track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
        </p>
        <p>We may also use local shared objects (also known as &quot;flash cookies&quot;) to assist in delivering
            special content, such as video clips or animation. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are not
            managed through your web browser. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe
            website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.</p>

        <p>We may display information related to your business, including your name or your business&rsquo;s name,
            publicly on your profile, except to the extent we tell you we will not display such information. If the
            information you provide us upon signing up for an account differs from the information you provide us as
            part of the verification data we collect, we have sole discretion in determining which information will be
            displayed publicly on your profile. We may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform
            with information that we obtain from affiliated and non-affiliated third-parties, and information derived
            from any other products or services we provide.</p>
        <p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Platform. We may use de-identified or
            aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes and may
            also share such data with any third-parties, including without limitation, advertisers, promotional
            partners, sponsors, event promoters, and/or others.</p>
        <p>We may, either directly or through third-parties we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, or
            analyze your communications with other Users exchanged via the Platform or as otherwise described in this
            Policy for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development,
            research and User support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we may scan and
            analyze messages to prevent fraud or improper actions. We may also scan, review or analyze messages for
            research and product development purposes, as well as to debug, improve and expand product offerings. By
            using the Platform or engaging in off-Platform communications tracked by Gethelp, you consent that
            Gethelp, in its sole discretion, may, either directly or through third-parties we engage to provide
            services to us, review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether done manually or through
            automated means.</p>
        <h2>WHEN THUMBTACK DISCLOSES YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Unless otherwise described in this Policy, we may also share the information that we collect from you through
            the Platform as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Affiliates. We may share your information with any Gethelp affiliates.</li>
            <li>Consent. We may disclose your information to nonaffiliated third-parties based on your consent to do so.
                Such consent includes the disclosure of your information (a) in order to provide services or products
                that you have requested (please see below for more details); (b) when we have your permission; or (c) as
                described in this Policy, our Terms of Use, or any other legal terms governing your use of the Platform.
            </li>
            <li>Service Providers. We may provide access to your information to select third-parties who perform
                services on our behalf. These third-parties provide a variety of services to us including without
                limitation billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis
                and processing, identity verification, fraud and safety protection and legal services. As we retain new
                service providers, we generally seek contractual assurances from these service providers that they will
                not use your information in any manner other than to help us provide you with the services and products
                available from Gethelp.</li>
            <li>Legal Requirements. We may disclose your information when required by law or when we believe in good
                faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with subpoenas, court orders, or other legal
                process we receive; (b) establish or exercise our legal rights including enforcing and administering
                agreements with Users; or (c) defend Gethelp against legal claims. If we are required by law to
                disclose your information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you unless (1) we
                believe in our sole discretion that providing notice could create a risk of injury or death, or that
                harm or fraud could be directed to Gethelp or Users; or (2) we are precluded from providing notice by
                law. We will attempt to provide the notice by email if you have given us an email address. While you may
                challenge the disclosure request, please be advised we may still be legally required to turn over your
                information.</li>
            <li>Protection of Gethelp and Others. We may disclose your information to whomever necessary when we
                believe it appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities,
                suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations
                of the Terms of Use or any other legal terms governing use of the Platform, and/or to protect our rights
                and property and the rights and property of other Users.</li>
            <li>Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
                other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such contemplated or actual
                transactions or where there is any change of control of Gethelp, User information may be among the
                shared and/or transferred assets.</li>
            <li>App Store Providers. We may provide your identity and mobile device identifier to third-party app store
                providers (for example, the Apple App Store) to allow you to download our mobile apps.</li>
            <li>Academics and Research. We may provide information about Users to third-parties for academic and
                research purposes, in anonymized or aggregated form.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please be advised that some information you provide and/or that we collect will be publicly accessible. For
            instance, registration for an account requires that you provide us with your name. If you register through
            Facebook, the Platform will use the name associated with your Facebook account. Your name (full name, or in
            some instances, your first name and last initial) may be visible to other Users. Depending on the
            circumstances, your name may be attached to your Content or information, such as scheduling of Pro Services,
            service requests, reviews, participating in discussions or forums, messaging, and profile information.
            Certain other people, including other Users with whom you have interacted via the Platform, will see
            information about you that is attached to your name. For example (but without limitation), if you are a
            Consumer seeking Pro Services, the description you provide of your desired services, along with your name,
            will be shown to some Service Professionals registered in the relevant category along with your name. Thus,
            other Users may be able to personally identify you based on Content you provide. Similarly, the information
            we collect, including but not limited to when you last accessed the Platform, may be shared with other Users
            with whom you are interacting or otherwise made public.</p>
        <p>We invite you to post Content on or through our Platform, including, but not limited to, your comments,
            pictures, Service Professional profile, and any other information. However, please be careful and
            responsible whenever you are online. If you choose to post User Content on or through the Platform, such as
            through User-to-User messaging or through our review boards, forums, blogs, or other postings, that
            information: (a) may be or may become publicly available; (b) may be collected and used by third-parties
            with or without our knowledge; and (c) may be used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or
            your personal privacy.</p>
        <h2>ONLINE ANALYTICS AND TAILORED ADVERTISING</h2>
        <p><em>Analytics</em></p>
        <p>We may use third-party web analytics services on the Platform, such as those of Google Analytics. These
            service providers use the sort of technology described in the sections above to help us analyze how Users
            use the Platform, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information
            collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use
            the information to evaluate your use of the Platform. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes
            related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your
            information for analytics, you may install the&nbsp;<a
                href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>
        <p><em>Tailored Advertising</em></p>
        <p>Third-parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the Platform may also place cookies
            or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about
            your use of the Platform in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on past visits
            to our websites and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content impressions, other uses of
            marketing services, and interactions with these marketing impressions and marketing services are related to
            visits to our websites. We also allow other third-parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google
            Analytics, DoubleClick, Facebook and others) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own
            cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the
            Platform. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking
            technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the
            Platform by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated
            third-parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted
            advertising as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser.
            Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have
            submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed,
            non-human-readable form.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally
            control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the&nbsp;<a

                Link&nbsp;</a>and/or the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">Digital Advertising
                Alliance&apos;s Consumer Opt-Out Link&nbsp;</a>to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from
            companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or
            customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the&nbsp;<a
                href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings page</a> page. Please note that to the
            extent advertising technology is integrated into the Platform, you may still receive advertising content
            even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored
            to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any
            choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If
            your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase
            your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be
            effective. Additional information is available on NAI&apos;s and DAA&apos;s websites, accessible by the
            above links.</p>
        <p>When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertising content. Each
            operating system (iOS for Apple devices, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices)
            provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application marketing content.
            You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in
            order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertising. For any other devices and/or operating systems,
            please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.</p>
        <h2>PRIVACY OF MINORS</h2>
        <p>Our services are not designed for minors under the age of 18. Only persons 18 years of age or older may use
            the Platform. If we discover that an individual under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will
            close the account and delete that individual&rsquo;s personal information to the extent required by the
            Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act. We may, where permitted by law, retain certain information
            internally for purposes described in this Policy.</p>
        <h2>SECURITY</h2>
        <p>We employ physical, procedural, and technological security measures to help protect your personal information
            from unauthorized access or disclosure. Gethelp may use encryption, passwords, and physical security
            measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. No security
            measures, however, are 100% failsafe. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should
            not expect, that your personal information or communications will not be collected, disclosed and/or used by
            others. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer
            by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody
            else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password private, and not recycling passwords from
            other websites or accounts. Gethelp is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor
            for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized
            password activity.</p>
        <h2>LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS</h2>
        <p>The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over which Gethelp does not have any control.
            Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Gethelp of those external websites. You acknowledge that
            Gethelp is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Gethelp is not
            responsible for the content of such external websites or the protection and privacy of information you
            provide while visiting such external websites.</p>
        <h2>UPDATING, DELETING, AND CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>You may review, correct, and delete certain information about you by logging in to the Platform and
            navigating to your preferences page in &quot;Your Dashboard.&quot; You must promptly update your account
            information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your
            profile information from view as soon as reasonably possible. We may retain information from closed accounts
            in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot
            problems, assist with any investigations of any User, enforce our Terms of Use, and/or for any other
            purposes otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole discretion. You should understand,
            however, that once you transmit User Content through the Platform, you may not be able to change or remove
            it. Once we have deactivated or removed your account, you agree that Gethelp will not be responsible to
            you for retaining information related to your account.</p>
        <h2>YOUR CHOICES</h2>
        <p>We may send periodic emails to you. You may opt out of promotional emails by following the opt-out
            instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process
            opt-out requests. If you opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may
            interest you, we may still send you emails about your account or any services you have requested or received
            from us.</p>
        <p>We may monitor and record our telephone conversations with you for training and quality assurance purposes.
            You will be provided with a notice at the beginning of any call that is being recorded.</p>
        <h2>CALIFORNIA NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES</h2>
        <p>If you are a California resident (as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act), you may have certain
            rights. For more information, please see the&nbsp;<a

                Privacy Notice for California Residents</a> below.</p>
        <h2>NOTICE FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS</h2>
        <p>Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of &ldquo;personally identifiable
            information&rdquo; for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such
            information to additional persons. &ldquo;Personally identifiable information&rdquo; includes first and last
            name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific
            person to be contacted either physically or online.</p>
        <p>We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or
            services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law
            by&nbsp;<a href="mailto:NevadaOptOut@gethelp.com">NevadaOptOut@gethelp.com</a>. Please note we will take
            reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will

        <h2>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
        <p>THIS POLICY IS CURRENT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE SET FORTH ABOVE. THUMBTACK MAY, IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE
            DISCRETION, CHANGE THIS POLICY AT ANY TIME. THUMBTACK WILL POST ITS UPDATED POLICY ON THE PLATFORM, SEND YOU
            A MESSAGE OR OTHERWISE NOTIFY YOU WHEN YOU ARE LOGGED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. THUMBTACK ENCOURAGES YOU TO REVIEW
            THIS POLICY REGULARLY FOR ANY CHANGES. YOUR CONTINUED ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PLATFORM WILL BE SUBJECT TO
            THE TERMS OF THE THEN-CURRENT POLICY.</p>
        <h2>CONSENT TO TRANSFER</h2>
        <p>Our computer systems are currently based in the United States and Canada, so your personal data will be
            processed by us in the United States and Canada, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer
            the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. If you create an account with the Platform as a
            visitor from outside the United States, by using the Platform, you agree to this Policy and you consent to
            the transfer of all such information to the United States and Canada, which may not offer a level of
            protection equivalent to that required in certain other countries, and to the processing of that information
            as described in this Policy.</p>

        <p>This Supplemental Privacy Notice supplements the information in our Privacy Policy above, and except as
            provided herein, applies solely to California residents (as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act
            (CCPA)). It applies to personal information we collect on or through the Platform and through other means
            (such as information collected offline, in person, and over the telephone). It does not apply to personal
            information we collect from Service Professionals in their capacity as Service Professionals. Employees of
            Gethelp, Inc. and job applicants to jobs at Gethelp, Inc. are also not covered by this Supplemental
            Privacy Notice</p>
        <h2>Summary of Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>California law requires us to disclose information regarding the categories of personal information that we
            have collected about California consumers, the categories of sources from which we collect personal
            information, the business or commercial purposes (as each of those terms are defined by applicable law) for
            which we collect personal information, and the categories of parties with whom we share personal
            information.</p>
        <p>As described further in our Privacy Policy above, in the preceding twelve months, we or our service providers
            may have collected the below categories of personal information for business or commercial purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifiers (such as account information, name, email address, address, phone number, or social network
                account and profile data);</li>
            <li>Commercial information (such as transaction data);</li>
            <li>Financial data (such as payment information);</li>
            <li>Internet or other network or device activity (such as IP address, unique device, advertising, and app
                identifiers, browsing history or other usage data);</li>
            <li>Location information (general location, and, if you provide permission, precise GPS location);</li>
            <li>Sensory information (such as audio recordings if you call our customer service);</li>
            <li>Inferences about your project preferences and traits; and</li>
            <li>Other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you (such as User-generated
                content, e.g. reviews).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We collect the categories of personal information identified above from the following sources: (1) directly
            from you; (2) through your use of the Platform; (3) affiliates; and (4) third-parties such as other Users or
            vendors.</p>
        <p>We or our service providers may collect the categories of information identified above for the following
            business or commercial purposes (as those terms are defined in applicable law):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our or our service provider&rsquo;s operational purposes;</li>
            <li>Auditing consumer interactions on our site (e.g., measuring ad impressions);</li>
            <li>Detecting, protecting against, and prosecuting security incidents, fraudulent or illegal activity and
                activity that violates any terms or policies;</li>
            <li>Bug detection, error reporting, and activities to maintain the quality or safety of our services;</li>
            <li>Short-term, transient use, such as customizing content that we or our service providers display on
                services;</li>
            <li>Providing services (e.g., account servicing and maintenance, order processing and fulfillment, customer
                service, advertising and marketing, analytics, communication about our services, administering surveys,
                contests, and promotions, enabling you to find a Service Professional to provide services to you,
                facilitating communications between Users);</li>
            <li>Improving our existing services and developing new services (e.g., by conducting research to develop new
                products or features, or to train our employees on issues that our Users need to be resolved);</li>
            <li>Other uses that advance our commercial or economic interests, such as third-party advertising and
                communicating with you about relevant offers from third-party partners;</li>
            <li>Other uses about which we notify you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We describe our information sharing practices in the Privacy Policy above. In the previous twelve months, we
            may have shared certain categories of personal information with third-parties for business purposes. For
            example, we may share your personal information with other Users, such as Service Professionals when you
            request professional services. The personal information shared may include the following categories of
            personal information: (1) identifiers; (2) commercial information (such as the type of professional services
            you are seeking); (3) location information (e.g. to describe where you are seeking professional services);
            and (4) other information that can be associated with you (such as information related to a home improvement
            project).</p>
        <p>Examples of these types of uses are identified below. We may also use the below categories of personal
            information for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and we may combine the information we
            collect (&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo;) or remove pieces of information (&ldquo;de-identify&rdquo;) to limit or
            prevent identification of any particular User or device.</p>
        <h3>Rights</h3>
        <p>If you are a California resident (as defined by the CCPA), you may have certain rights. California law may
            permit you to request that we:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last
                twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for
                collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third-parties with whom we shared
                personal information.</li>
            <li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</li>
            <li>Delete certain information we have about you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.
            You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising
            certain of your rights referenced herein. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under
            applicable law. In addition, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our services to
            you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our services.</p>
        <p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request at&nbsp;<a
                href="mailto:dataprivacy@gethelp.com">dataprivacy@gethelp.com</a> or visit&nbsp;<a
                href="https://help.gethelp.com/data-privacy">https://help.gethelp.com/data-privacy</a>. You will be
            required to verify your identity before we are able to fulfill your request, for instance by logging into
            the Gethelp platform. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do
            so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to
            act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.</p>
        <p>The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that &ldquo;sell&rdquo; personal information.
            Gethelp shares certain personal information of Consumers with select Service Professionals to better
            enable those Consumers to find a Service Professional who can provide a service the Consumer has expressed
            interest in. Gethelp also shares certain information with its marketing partners who do not qualify as
            &ldquo;service providers&rdquo; under the CCPA. To opt out of such sharing, you may click&nbsp;<a
                href="https://www.gethelp.com/syndication-opt-out">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Metrics</h3>
        <p>California law may require us to compile the following metrics for the previous calendar year: the number of
            rights requests received, complied with, and denied, as well as the median number of days within which we
            responded to those requests. To the extent this obligation applies to Gethelp, we will update this section
            after the CCPA has been in effect for a year.</p>
        <h3>California Shine the Light</h3>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you may ask for a list of third-parties that have received your information
            for direct marketing purposes during the previous calendar year. If we have shared your information, this
            list will contain the types of information shared, and we will provide this list at no cost. To make such a
            request, contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataprivacy@gethelp.com">dataprivacy@gethelp.com</a>.</p>
        <h3>California Do-Not-Track Disclosure</h3>
        <p>Gethelp is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our
            Platform for third-party purposes. That is why we have provided links (above) to the NAI &quot;Consumer
            Opt-Out&quot; link, the DAA opt-out link, and a Google opt-out link. However, Gethelp does not currently
            recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still
            working on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations, and solutions.</p>
